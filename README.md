# hugo-mock-landing-page-automated

Part 2 of second homework in CIS 3500, a software engineering class at Penn taught by Jérémie Lumbroso.

Assignment completed by Ash Fujiyama

This project is the culmination of learning how to automate website deployment of [a landing page made in a previous homework](https://github.com/ashfujiyama/hugo-mock-landing-page).  This website will update itself every time changes are pushed.

## Steps Taken

1. Imported my repository linked above, updated the url in the config file
2. Added the deployment yaml file, used claude to understand how it works
3. Configure the repository settings: change GITHUB_TOKEN permissions to read *and write*, changed the publishing source to gh-pages, and changed permissions to allow all actions
4. Test and debug deployment
